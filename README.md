# fruit-ripeness-classification
Fruit ripeness classification using VIT aided by semantic segmentation and GAN-based data augmentation.

# Model Planning

## Requirements

## Use cases and user persona

## Risks

### Risks mitigation

## Development tools
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Dataset

### Data management
Augmentations by random crop, flip, rotation and GAN-based data points generation.

## Tests

## Model type and instance

## Explainability strategy
Use of LIME as introduced in the paper ["Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939778).
The official code for running LIME is available at [https://github.com/marcotcr/lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).

# Model development
* TODO: Implement dataset-to-model interface
* TODO: Implement model training
* TODO: Implement model evaluation
* TODO: Test models against use-cases
